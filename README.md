# 2) Why I find it interesting? 


Replit is a new tool for software developers. With github, I'm always worried about making changes where my teammates have made changes as well. For example, if I edit a piece of code and someone else edits the same piece of code, then we know that it happened but it still requires a lot of work and communication to see which copy to push to the main branch. So, github requires outside communication or excellent work divide. However, replit changes this. Replit is more like google drive where the edits are live and we can also run the code in their IDE. They also have small jobs for software developers if someone is interested in making money. They also released a ghostwriter which is an AI that helps you write code. It's a great tool for people who like to code and I think it could be the future of programming. 


## Kei's comments:

Last semester, one of my professors used Replit, and it was pretty cool. I'm curious how they could implement writing simultaneously, similar to Google Docs, as I'm unfamiliar with it. I haven't tried its ghostwriting AI before, but I assume it resembles something like GitHub Copilot. I look forward to seeing how it can be further developed.
